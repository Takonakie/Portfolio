I want to create an interactive and aesthetic IT portfolio website using ReactJS and GSAP to showcase my projects.

The website should include common sections for an IT portfolio:

About Me: A brief introduction about myself, my background, and my interests.

Skills: A list of my technical skills (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, tools), ideally with visual indicators.

Projects: The main section to display my IT projects. Each project should have:

A title and a brief description.

An image/video preview.

Links to the GitHub repository and/or a live demo.

Engaging transition animations when project details are opened/closed.

Experience: Relevant work or organizational experience.

Contact: A simple contact form or my contact information (email, LinkedIn, etc.).

Interactive Animation Features (with GSAP)
Hero Section: An appealing opening animation when the website first loads (e.g., text appearing one by one, elements sliding in).

Navigation: Smooth and responsive transitions when switching between sections, possibly with parallax effects or interesting scroll effects.

Scroll-triggered Animations: Elements dynamically appearing or moving as they scroll into the viewport (e.g., skill bars filling up, project cards appearing with an effect).

Hover Effects: Interactive animations when hovering over specific elements (e.g., buttons, project cards, icons).

Loader/Preloader: An aesthetic loading animation while the website loads content.

Aesthetic Design
Minimalist yet Modern Design: Focus on ample whitespace, readable typography, and a cohesive color palette.

Responsive: Optimal display across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Smooth Transitions: Use GSAP animations to create a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

Appealing Visuals: Incorporate relevant illustrations, icons, or high-quality images.

Technologies
Frontend: ReactJS

Animations: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

(Optional) State Management: [If needed: Redux, Context API, Zustand, Jotai]

Expectations
Clean, well-structured, and easy-to-understand code.

Fast performance without animation-induced slowdowns.

A unique design that reflects my personality.
